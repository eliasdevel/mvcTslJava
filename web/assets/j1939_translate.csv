00 Override disabled - Disable any existing control commanded by the source of this command.
01 Speed control - Govern speed to the included “desired speed” value.
10 Torque control - Control torque to the included “desired torque” value.
11 Speed/torque limit control - Limit speed and/or torque based on the included limit values.  The speed limit governor is a droop governor where the speed limit value defines the speed at the maximum torque available during this operation.

If a device wants to know whether it has access to the engine, there are several possibilities:

a. Comparing its command with the actual engine broadcasts.
b. Looking at command modes from other devices.
c. Looking to the engine and retarder torque mode.

Remarks:

a. The realization of a torque limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the speed limit to a high value (0xFAFF).
b. The realization of a speed limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the torque limit to a high value (0xFA).
c. Limiting the retarder torque means to limit the magnitude of the torque request.  As the brake torque is represented by negative torque values, the limitation must be done by a maximum selection of the requested torque and the retarder internal torque signals.
d. For torque increasing functions, time limits for the torque or speed value (command) and the direct modes are desirable.

e. The selection of which device has control of the engine's speed or torque depends on the override mode priority (see SPN 897) with the highest priority device gaining control.  In the case of two devices with identical priority, the engine responds to speed/torque control commands over speed/torque limit commands and will act on the speed or torque commands on a first come, first served basis.  The torque limit will be a “lowest wins” selection (e.g., if one device commands 60% limit and another 80% limit, then the engine will limit torque to 60%).  Figure SPN695_A provides a flowchart of the torque/speed control priority selection logic.","0 to 3",,"4 states/2 bit",0,"bit",1 de out de 98,"Published",30/11/2003,"Published","J1939-71","J1939-71"

01b - This control condition has been optimized to minimize rpm overshoot and undershoot given an expected plant consisting of the engine and its accessory loads.  This gain adjustment is not intended to compensate for driveline characteristics.  This characteristic is most appropriate when no driveline is connected.

The default is 11 (Low priority).  It is not required to use the same priority during the entire override function.  For example, the transmission can use priority 01 (High priority) during a shift, but can set the priority to 11 (Low priority) at the end of the shift to allow traction control to also interact with the torque limit of the engine.

The four priority levels defined are:

00 Highest priority
01 High priority
10 Medium priority
11 Low priority

00b - Highest Priority = Used for situations that require immediate action by the receiving device in order to provide safe vehicle operation (i.e., braking systems).  This level of priority should only be used in safety critical conditions.

01b -  High Priority  =  Used for control situations that require prompt action in order to provide safe vehicle operation.  An example is when the transmission is performing a shift and requires control of the engine in order to control driveline reengagement.

10b - Medium Priority = Used for powertrain control operations which are related to assuring that the vehicle is in a stable operating condition.  An example is when the traction control system is commanding the engine in order to achieve traction stability.

11b - Low Priority = Used to indicate that the associated command desires powertrain control but is needed for function which improves the driver comfort which may be overridden by other devices.  An example is cruise control or the non-critical part of a transmission shift to a new gear.","0 to 3",,"4 states/2 bit",0,"bit",1 de out de 98,"Published",,"Published","J1939-71","J1939-71"

These transmission responses occur regardless of shift selector (Forward, Neutral or Reverse) position at the time the request is received.

This request would typically come from a component wishing to override the vehicle operator’s ability to shift or keep the transmission in Reverse.  For example, the control system of a rear-loading refuse packer may wish to prevent shifts to reverse when it detects the presence of someone behind the vehicle.

Reverse gear shift inhibits include all ‘Neutral-to-Reverse’ shifts and ‘Forward-to-Reverse’ shifts; the ability of the transmission to complete ‘Neutral-to-Forward’ or ‘Forward-to-Forward’ gear shifts is not impacted.

If the transmission is in Reverse or attempting to shift to Reverse and receives an active Reverse gear shift inhibit request (0b01), the transmission will shift to Neutral.  When the request subsequently goes inactive (0b00), the transmission will remain in Neutral until it receives a selector input from the vehicle operator requesting it to shift into a Non-Neutral gear.  The transmission should not automatically return to the previous gear when this signal goes inactive.

Transmission response to this request can be monitored via SPN 4261 – Transmission Reverse Gear Shift Inhibit Status, SPN 523 Transmission Current Gear, and SPN 524 Transmission Selected Gear.

Forward selector position from drive (0xF5 to 0xEF) – Indicates shift selector position in reference to the ‘Drive’ position on the selector.  It is possible that the shift selector software may not know the number of forward ranges.  The shift selector may identify the position selected by the operator while the transmission ECU determines what range or gear that represents.  If there is a digital display, the transmission ECU would communicate what is to be displayed via another message such as ETC#2 or ETC#7.

For example:  Consider a vehicle with a 5-speed automatic transmission with the shift lever on the column. Suppose that shift selector has a limited number of positions, such that having positions for D-4-3-2-1 is not an option. For this example, assume there are only have enough lever positions for D-3-2-1. Pulling the lever into ""D"" will put the transmission in 5th (highest gear).  It is desired that pulling the lever to the physical “3” position will limit the transmission to a maximum range of 3rd gear.

When the selector is pulled down into ""3"", the shifter selector itself has no way of correlating this physical lever position to the desired gear; it would have to be calibrated with software to tell it this information. If not calibrated, the shift selector cannot directly command the transmission to go to 3rd gear; it only knows it's one notch below drive.

However, if ""D-1"" (lever position, as opposed to desired gear) is broadcast by the selector, the transmission ECU can receive this and then make the determination of what range is desired. The benefit is that no specific calibration of the shift selector is required. 

Between selector positions (0xEE to 0xE2) – Indicates the shift selector is not in an appropriate position.  If a lever-type shift selector with a mechanical display is stuck between detents, it may appear to the operator that it is in the desired position when in fact it is not. The shift selector may be capable of reporting only that it is between positions or that it is between forward or reverse positions. If known, the transmission ECU may respond differently depending on which positions are involved.

Reselect current position (0xE1) - If the TC1 message continues to send the position last selected, then a capability to reselect the same position is required.  For example:  If a ‘Neutral to Drive’ shift is selected and that shift is inhibited (say for high engine speed), it may be necessary for the operator to reselect ‘Drive’ after the inhibit conditions pass in order for the transmission ECU to honor the request.

Position unknown and/or no buttons pressed (0xE0) - A push-button style shift selector with momentary contact buttons may send this indicator after initialization before any buttons are pressed, or before the transmission ECU determines and communicates the initial selection.  This indicator could also be sent between button presses as an alternative to sending the last button press.","-125 to 125","-64 to 64","1 gear value/bit",-125,"gear value",9 de nov de 00,"Published",20/11/2003,"Published","J1939-71","J1939-71"

1024,"External Brake Request","8","when active: 20 ms; else 200 ms","XBR","4",8,4099,"XBR urgency","The idea of the urgency value is to adjust the endurance brake integration behavior in the EBS system according to the traffic situation.

On low urgency values (0%, e.g. downhill cruise control or preceding vehicle far ahead) the brake system shall primarily use endurance brakes to reduce lining wear.

On high urgency values (100%, e.g. vehicle close up or a vehicle cuts into the traffic line just before host vehicle) the brake system is expected to gain the demanded deceleration (acceleration) as fast as possible.

Values:
0% - Situation not critical; low retarder dynamics are tolerated. Activation of the foundation brakes after a time if retarder performance is insufficient
y % - Faster activation of foundation brakes to compensate retarder performance, linear interpolation between 0 and  100%
100% - Low retarder dynamics shall be fully compensated by the foundation brakes

Notes:
- This parameter has only an effect if XBR EBI switch is set to ""10: endurance brake integration allowed""
- XBR urgency makes sense only if the XBR request(s) is (are) processed in one device like the EBS controller which also sends TSC1 to the retarder(s). Such a data flow diagram is shown in figure PGN1024_A. When the Retarder is controlled directly by the XBR transmitter XBR urgency should be set to not available.

In adaptive cruise control (ACC) operation there are situations where it is useful to have as less lining wear as possible like keeping the set speed on going downhill. It would not be useful to activate foundation brakes in such a situation except when the capabilities of the endurance brakes are not sufficient.
 
In other situations like emergency braking or fast reaction on a car that cut in at a short distance in front of the own vehicle a reaction as fast as possible is needed. In such cases low retarder dynamics must be compensated by the foundation brakes.

There are two different ways to integrate the endurance brakes into the adaptive cruise control.
a) the request for deceleration could be processed by the EBS system completely. This means that the EBS receives the deceleration demand and activates the friction and/or the endurance brakes accordingly. EBS is sending the TSC1 to the retarder. (see figure PGN1024_A dataflow diagram for external brake request)
b) the ACC sends XBR to the brake controller and TSC1 to the endurance brakes.

In case ""a)"" the ACC system does not have direct control of the endurance brakes. To adjust the endurance brakes according to the traffic situation (high or low urgency values see above) this new SPN is needed.

If the retarder performance is not sufficient (e.g. because of high retarder temperature) the foundation brakes will be added automatically. This case of not sufficient retarder performance cannot be covered by switching EBI mode from 01 (endurance brakes only) to EBI mode 10 (endurance brake integration allowed) because the actual deceleration caused by the retarder is less than the requested decelleration. A simple switching (01 to 10) would cause an uncomfortable jerk.

Below is extended information describing each command.  The purpose of this information is to define what command state should be reported based on what auto control mode command is deemed appropriate by the operational specifications of the system.

   0000 Auto Allowed - Auto mode permitted as appropriate (auto button was pushed or directly returned from Suspend Auto condition)
   0001 Activity Allows Auto - Auto mode permitted only if the primary control system detects operator activity.  The control issuing this command does not have sufficient information/reason to absolutely allow Auto mode (state 0000) or not allow Auto mode (state 0100).  The control issuing this command is permitting the primary control system to operate in auto mode only if the primary control system detects operator activity, such as direct input to the primary control system.  If the primary control system does not detect operator activity, then the control issuing this command is not allowing auto mode. For example, the control issuing this command has detected no operator activity yet it acknowledges that there may be other sources of operator activity that might make auto mode permissible.
   0010 Suspend Auto - Auto mode is temporarily not allowed and the control issuing this command wants the primary control system to automatically return to the previous state (Auto or Manual) when the suspend auto condition is removed.
   0011 Service Mode - Auto mode is permitted only for special services such as calibrations.
   0100 Auto Not Allowed - Auto mode is not allowed under any condition

Note:  
The control issuing this command is aware that it does not have access to all information that the primary controller of the Land Leveling System attachment has access to.

In some cases, like in the ""Activity Allows Auto"" situation, the control knows the Land Leveling system has access to an additional display (which has switches and several buttons) which may help determine if an operator is present.

One method uses the direct operator control input to determine the operator control state, while the second method relies on a secondary control to read the operator control input, then relay the information on the data link.  The parameter is designed to provide the actual operator control state to other controls that need the information.
2.  Other systems with automated blade controls should be able to use this parameter, since it is an actual operator control value.","0 to 15",,"16 states/4 bit",0,"bit",19 de mai de 04,"Published",19/05/2004,"Published","J1939-71","J1939-71"

When an implement moves in a side-shift direction, it moves from side to side, usually along its longitudinal axis. The desired side-shift offset value is the offset measured from a given vertical reference point to the center of the blade.

Only one of the following states will be active at a time. In the example below, the data values are defined for each switch type that may be used in an application. The purpose of the following switch information is to define what data should be reported based on what type of switch is used.

1. The momentary rocker switch may be used, where the default is the neutral position with no buttons pressed. The user can press the rocker into the increment button pressed position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the neutral position. The user may also press the rocker into the decrement button pressed position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the neutral position.  Momentary rocker button usage is as follows:

 - Neutral position = 0000   No Operator Control Request
 - Increment Button Pressed = 0001 Increment Operator Control Request
 - Decrement Button Pressed = 0010 Decrement Operator Control Request

2. The momentary contact button pair may be used, where the default is the neutral position with no buttons pressed. The user can press the increment button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the neutral position. The user may press the decrement button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the neutral position. Momentary contact button (button pair) usage is as follows:

 - No Button Pressed = 0000 No Operator Control Request
 - Increment Button Pressed = 0001 Increment Operator Control Request
 - Decrement Button Pressed = 0010 Decrement Operator Control Request

When an implement moves in a side-shift direction, it moves from side to side, usually along its longitudinal axis.

The operator control value directly correlates to the current operator control state.  Only one of the following states will be active at a time.  In the example below, the data values are defined for each switch type that may be used in an application.  The purpose of the following switch information is to define what data should be reported based on what type of switch is used.

1.  A toggle button with two states can be used, in which the button is either in the manual or the auto position at all times.  Toggle button usage is as follows:
     Manual Position  = 0010 Manual Operator Control Request
     Auto Position  = 0011 Automatic Operator Control Request

2.  The momentary rocker switch may be used, where the default is the no button pressed position.  The user can press the rocker into the manual position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  The user may also press the rocker into the auto position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  Momentary rocker button usage is as follows:
     No Button Pressed = 0000 No Operator Control Request
     Manual Button Pressed  = 0010 Manual Operator Control Request
     Auto Button Pressed  = 0011 Automatic Operator Control Request

3.  The momentary contact button pair may be used, where the default is no buttons being pressed.  The user can press the manual button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  The user may press the auto button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  Momentary contact buttons (button pair) usage is as follows:
     No Button Pressed = 0000 No Operator Control Request
     Manual Button Pressed  = 0010 Manual Operator Control Request
     Auto Button Pressed  = 0011 Automatic Operator Control Request

4.  The momentary contact single button may be used, where the default is no button being pressed.  The user can press the button, which is the button pressed position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  The controller receiving this command will keep track of what mode the blade is in, auto or manual.  If the blade is in manual mode to begin with, one press of the button will change to mode to auto.  If the button is pressed again, the blade will be put into manual mode.  Momentary contact button (single button) usage is as follows:
     No Button Pressed = 0000 No Operator Control Request

The vehicle system design should also consider the impact of timing latency in the engine starting sequence.

The intention is to protect transmissions that use a continuous torque limit during torque converter mode or operation in specific lower gears, where stall or drivetrain torque may reach levels higher than the gearbox capacity.  If communication is lost during torque limited operation, unrestricted engine torque output could harm the transmission.

It is recommended that engines use reception of the ETC#1 message as a transmission “heartbeat”.  In the event that the ETC#1 message is not received in a time period of 5 times its’ broadcast rate (5 x 10 ms = 50 ms), the engine should invoke a torque limit holding the engine to less than or equal to the value of the Transmission Torque Limit parameter.  The engine may release the limit when transmission-to-engine communication is re-established.

A value of 0xFF00 to 0xFFFF indicates that no transmission torque limit is desired.

It is expected that the engine will record this torque value in non-volatile memory and will include this in the engine configuration PGN as parameter Engine Default Torque Limit (SPN 1846)

If the engine observes change in this parameter value on power-up, the engine should record the new value.","0 to 64,255 Nm",,"1 Nm/bit",0,"Nm",9 de nov de 00,"Published",31/12/2001,"Published","J1939-71","J1939-71"

These heights are discrete levels.  They are the upper level, lower level, normal level 1, normal level 2, normal level 3, customer level, and preset level.  Refer to Figure SPN1734_A.

· Upper Level is the highest mechanically available height of the vehicle.  
· Lower Level is the lowest mechanically available height of the vehicle.  

Normal Levels 1, 2 and 3 are heights normally used during driving.
· Normal Level 1 is most often used and is given by design.  
· Normal Level 2 may be chosen, for example, to be lower than Normal Level 1 for the purpose of reducing fuel consumption while driving on highways.  
· Normal Level 3 may be chosen above Normal Level 1 for driving off road.

The preset level has to be set by means of ASC 6 (PGN: 53504).

The states characterize independent system states (e.g., it is not possible to express distance control active and overtake mode simultaneously). ACC must not switch itself off while active because the driver expects it to work. So if an error occurs, the ACC must signal that to the driver so that the driver knows that he has to switch off the ACC.

000b - Off—Used to indicate the ACC is enabled in calibration or configuration and there are no faults that would prevent the system from operating.
001b - Speed Control Active—Used to indicate that ACC is on but not currently sending control messages.  In other words, there is no target ahead and regular vehicle cruise control is controlling the vehicle speed to the driver’s set speed.
010b - Distance Control Active—Used to indicate that ACC is on and actively sending control messages to maintain the appropriate following interval.
011b - Overtake Mode—Used to indicate that ACC is on but temporarily disabled because the driver is manually overriding cruise control by using either the accelerator pedal or the cruise control “accel” switch.
100b - Hold Mode—Used to indicate that the ACC has lost the previous target vehicle and is in HOLD mode. In this mode, the ACC shall limit the speed to the speed held when the target was lost. For example,  if the driver activates the typical cruise buttons (Resume/Inc/Dec) the HOLD mode shall be exited and normal cruise functionality resumed. If a new target is detected, the Distance Control Active mode (010b) is again entered, unless existing conditions prohibit this.
101b - Finish Mode—Used to indicate that ACC is on with no target ahead, and ACC is currently sending control messages to return to the driver’s set speed. This occurs when the target the ACC system was tracking moves out of the way so ACC returns the vehicle to the driver’s set speed.

If the engine supports this protection logic, the Engine Default Torque Limit parameter should be set equal to the Transmission Torque Limit parameter as received in the Transmission Configuration 2 message (PGN 65099).  Otherwise, an Engine Default Torque Limit value of FF00 to FFFF indicates that no engine default torque limit has been received or set.

The intention is to protect transmissions that use a continuous torque limit during torque converter mode or operation in specific lower gears, where stall or drivetrain torque may reach levels higher than the gearbox capacity.  If communication is lost during torque limited operation, unrestricted engine torque output could harm the transmission.

It is recommended that engines use reception of the ETC#1 message as a transmission “heartbeat”.  In the event that the ETC#1 message is not received in a time period of 5 times its’ broadcast rate (5 x 10 ms = 50 ms), the engine should invoke a torque limit holding the engine to less than or equal to the value of the Transmission Torque Limit parameter.
